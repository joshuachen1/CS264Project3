You will be prompted to enter a (positive) number of integers you wish to push onto the stack.

You will then be prompted to enter integers that will then be pushed onto the stack.

As you push integers onto the stack, the stack will sort them from least to greatest with the smallest element at the top of the stack.

Once you have entered the desired number of integers, the program will display them from least to greatest.
